## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/showcase.gif)

This project was made in order to further understand Java as well as the MVC architectural design pattern. This project acts as a standard graphical library management system, able to run multiple concurrent windows and update them all in real-time regardless of the order. In addition, this project contains multiple quality of life features allowing librarians to quickly sort and or monitor their current inventory of book, I hope this program ends up being of use to someone.

## Built With

This project was built with just the base Java libraries using JavaFX.
